# PeerLoanKart-Loan-Fraud-Detection-Datascience-Project
This project uses machine learning to predict whether a loan applicant will repay their loan. The project uses a dataset of historical loan data from PeerLoanKart, a peer-to-peer lending platform. 
> ***Project Domain : Banking/Loan***
## Problem Statement :
PeerLoanKart is an NBFC (Non-Banking Financial Company) which facilitates peer to peer loan.
It connects people who need money (borrowers) with people who have money (investors). As an investor, you would want to invest in people who showed a profile of having a high probability of paying you back.
