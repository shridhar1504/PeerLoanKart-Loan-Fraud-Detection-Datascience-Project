# PeerLoanKart-Loan-Fraud-Detection-Datascience-Project
This project uses machine learning to predict whether a loan applicant will repay their loan. The project uses a dataset of historical loan data from PeerLoanKart, a peer-to-peer lending platform. 
### Project Domain : Banking/Loan
## Problem Statement :
`Business Requirement` - PeerLoanKart is an NBFC (Non-Banking Financial Company) which facilitates peer to peer loan.
It connects people who need money (borrowers) with people who have money (investors). As an investor, you would want to invest in people who showed a profile of having a high probability of paying you back.

`Key issues` - Ensure NPAs are lower â€“ meaning PeerLoanKart wants to be very diligent in giving loans to borrower
## Solution Approach :
The aim is to create a model that will help predict whether a borrower will pay the loan or not. The main focus is on Lower NPA (Non Performing Asset) to creating the model. 
## Observation : 
The following observations were made during the project period. 
* The dataset of historical loan data from PeerLoanKart is a valuable resource for loan repayment prediction.
* A variety of classification algorithms can be used to predict loan repayment status.
* The model performance can be improved by using Feature Engineering and Hyperparameter tuning.
